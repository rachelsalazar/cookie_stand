        <p>One fall morning I woke up, got out of bed, and opened the window to a beautiful view of the foggy fishermans terminal here in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, WA. I loved the smell of the fresh sea air. Later that day, as I was baking cookies, sugar cookies, it came to me. Cookies, Seattle, salmon throwing down at Pike Place Market. Let's combine these things that people already love and make Salmon Cookies. That was three years ago now, and since then the business has blown up to 5 locations in the Seattle area and we are looking to add a sixth soon. Salmon cookies are my passion and I'm so happy to get to share them with you!</p>
